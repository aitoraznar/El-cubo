# El Cubo

A conversational game for Google Assistant.


# SCURE

SCURE is the same as SCUMM (Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion), but for El Cubo - Script Creation Utility for RIC Escape.

Check ric-escape-data to check an example of data the engine expects.

# TDD

I include a DialogFlowAppMock v1, that overwrites the DialogFlowApp v1 and uses as helper for tdd stuff.

I also developed a walkthrough script, which does all commands needed to finish the game
successfully. A nice side effect created by developing the game through tdd!

# Special thanks
The scaffolding project is based on Jordi Marti's [RIC Escape](https://github.com/jmarti-theinit/ric-escape), 
I want to thank him for share his huge effort with the community. Without RIC Escape's base-project, 
El Cubo would have taken longer than It took.
